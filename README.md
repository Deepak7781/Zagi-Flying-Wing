# Open Loop Dynamics of Zagi Flying Wing

## Introduction

-   **Zagi** is a radio-controlled (RC) flying wing glider introduced in
    1996 by Jerry Teisan in California.
-   Known in the RC community for:
    -   Simplicity
    -   Low cost
    -   High durability --- often referred to as "nearly indestructible"
-   **Construction:** Lightweight expanded polypropylene (EPP) foam
    covered with vinyl
-   **Flight Styles Supported:**
    -   Slope soaring (hill updraft)
    -   Thermal soaring (rising warm air)
    -   Electric-powered aerobatics
    -   Combat flying
-   **No tail surfaces:** Stability and control achieved through wing
    geometry and elevons

### Key Flying-Wing Advantages

-   High aerodynamic efficiency
-   Low drag due to no tail
-   Pitch stability from reflex airfoil
-   Compact and agile structure

> Variants include Zagi 400X, Zagi Fixx, Zagi THL -  all maintaining
> robust and efficient flying-wing principles.

## Airframe Breakdown

### 1. Wing Platform

-   Type: Swept flying wing (no fuselage or tail)
-   Span: Approximately 1.2 m (varies by model)
-   Planform: Tapered wing with moderate sweep
-   Material: EPP foam, laminated
-   Reinforcement: Carbon or fiberglass spar
-   Purpose:
    -   Enhances natural yaw and pitch stability
    -   Provides efficient lift distribution

### 2. Airfoil

-   Reflex or semi-reflex airfoil
-   Upward curvature near trailing edge creates positive pitching moment
-   Compensates for lack of tail
-   Examples: Zagi-specific foils, MH-series, Eppler reflex profiles
-   Allows trimmed hands-off stable flight

### 3. Control Surfaces (Elevons)

-   Two elevons on the trailing edge
-   Combined function of elevator and aileron
-   Symmetric movement provides pitch control
-   Differential movement provides roll control
-   No rudder - yaw stability through wing sweep and differential drag

### 4. Propulsion (Electric Versions)

-   Pusher motor mounted behind center section
-   Propeller behind trailing edge for improved aerodynamics
-   Battery placed in central fuselage pod

### 5. Stability and Aerodynamics

| Features | Purpose |
|:-----: | :----:|
|Reflex airfoil | Pitch stability (Positive Cm)  |
|Wing Sweep | Directional stability & yaw damping |
|Wing twist or wash out | Improve yaw stability and reduce induced drag |

>Because it's tailless, the zagi requires careful CG placement. Too far back --> unstable pitch oscillations; too forward --> sluggish response
